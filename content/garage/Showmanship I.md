**[[Showmanship II|NEXT: Showmanship II]]**

To be successful in life, we must have technical skills and showmanship (communication skills). 
A good showman always keeps three things in mind:
- **Sound** : articulation and tonality. 
- **Sight** : posture and gestures. 
- **Sync** : consistency in voice and body.

# Vocal Image

Using your voice is like playing an instrument. Five foundations that builds your vocal image are:

1. **Volume**: High volume shows confidence, energy, authority.
2. **Pace**: Control your rate of speech for emphasis.
3. **Pitch**: Melody makes you more memorable. 
4. **Pause**: It gives the listener time to process (no fillers).
5.  **Tonality**: ==Inject emotions into your words by elongating the vowels==. 

> [!NOTE] Melody in Speech 
> - Most people only use 2-3 keys of their vocal instrument; i.e., a "singsong voice"
> - By using all the notes in your instrument; you sound inspiring and interesting.


After learning how to play your *instrument*, you need to know how to write *good songs* (i.e., [[Storytelling]])
