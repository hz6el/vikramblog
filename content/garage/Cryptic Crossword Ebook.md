# What's Hidden In The Clues? A Guide To Solving Cryptic Crosswords 

## Elements of a Cryptic Clue:
- Every cryptic clue follows a structure: Definition + Wordplay.
- The definition points to the answer, while wordplay adds a puzzle aspect.
- Example: “Costly honey (4)” – The answer is **DEAR** (double definition: costly, and affectionate term).

## Common Cryptic Devices:

1. Double Definitions: Clues provide two meanings for one answer. (eg. Where a mineworker might be having money problems (2,1,4) — IN A HOLE)
2. Position Indicators: These are keywords that signal the type of wordplay used (eg. Explosives danger quashed by Emergency Services (8) — GRENADES).
3. Abbreviations: Cryptic crosswords often use abbreviations from various fields like: Roman numerals, chemistry (e.g. Au for gold), or geography (eg. IND for India).
4. Anagrams: Letters are scrambled and must be rearranged to form the answer. (eg. Mysterious nuclear explosion (7) — UNCLEAR)
5. Letter-Picking: Clues might ask solvers to pick certain letters (first, last, or middle) from words or phrases. (eg. How circle becomes ice? (6) — EVENLY)
6. Deletions: eg. Reasonable to be denied credit for eatable (6) — EDIBLE
7. Substitutions: eg. Fine for husband initiating beating is appropriate (7) — FITTING
8. Containers: Letters or words are placed inside others. 
9. Hidden Words: Some clues hide the answer within the surface text of the clue itself.
10. Reversals: reversed to find the answer. (eg. As one … yet free? Requires reversal of heart (6) — UNITED)
11. Homophones: find the synonyms for the word and spell it differently.
12. Spoonerisms: Syllables of words are swapped, like turning "crushing blow" into "blushing crow."
13. &lit or Clue As Definition: eg. He farms at sea with one net primarily (9) — FISHERMAN
14. Link Words: Small prepositions or conjunctions (like "of," "and," or "by") are used to connect definitions and wordplay meaningfully.

Solving Tips:
- Start with easier clues like anagrams or double definitions to build confidence.
- Use crossing letters (letters shared between words) to help solve trickier clues.
