Body language can either enhance communication or distract from it.

**Posture and position**: 
- Avoid facing away from the audience or standing in distracting areas. 
- Certain postures should be avoided, such as hands in pockets, hands on hips, or the "Fig Leaf" position.

***
**Gestures**: 
1. "Give" gesture for providing facts or options.
2. "Show" gesture for expressing emotions or descriptions.
3. "Chop" gesture for delivering strong opinions.

Palms up gestures are more effective in influencing audience compliance compared to palms down or finger pointing. (related: [[Showmanship I#^satir|Satir Categories]])
