The six critical ingredients for effective learning are: attention, alertness, sleep, repetition, taking breaks and making mistakes. 

***
# Focus (Attention+Alertness )

1. Doing 20min exercises, focus-attention meditation and breathing techniques helps to improve your attention and alertness. 
2. Caffeine can also improve alertness. 
3. Your alertness decreases after eating meals. 

> Ultradian Rhythm: 
> - Every 90 minutes, we go in and out of peak alertness
> - Chunks of peak alertness for the 8 to 30 mins

4. ==Have proper sleep - before and after studying==.

***
# Effects of Sleeping 
 - resets immune system, metabolism and emotional control 
 - get rids of "junk" during the day
 - short-term memory consolidates into long-term memories (from Hippocampus into the Cortex) 

***
# Repetition

Repetition is key to reinforcing connections in the brain and improving *recall*. 
**Practice Testing**: A type of active recall - flashcards, quizzes and mock test. (related: [[Note Taking methods]])
**Spaced repetition**:  involves spreading out learning sessions over multiple days; it tackles the forgetting curve. 
- Level of Intervals
	1. immediately after memorizing it
	2. before going to sleep
	3. 1 day later
	4. again before going to sleep
	5. 1 week later
	6. 3 weeks later
	7. 2 months later
	8. 6 months later
	9. 2 years later

> **One-trial learning**: We can learn things in one go when a strong emotional component is tied to an information.

***
# Taking Breaks
 
 - New information is unstable.
 - ==Avoid **retrograde interference** - which can occur when learning same things back-to-back==.
 - Take a 10 to 20 min break - rest or do mundane tasks.
 - Try learning something similar after 1 hr or preferably the next day.

***
# Mistakes

- Making mistakes increases activity in focused attention networks,
- It increases attention and creates a feeling of anxiety.
- Embracing and learning from mistakes ==creates opportunities for neuroplasticity==, 
- Don't wait till you are "prepared". 
- When we get it right, dopamine is released in your reward circuits, 
- Unlocking your adaptability.
