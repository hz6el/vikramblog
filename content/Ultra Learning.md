# ULTRA LEARNING 

The book "Ultra Learning" by Scott Young explores a strategy for intense, self-directed learning.

9 principles of ultra learning: 

1. **Metalearning** (10% of the time): 
	- mapping out the learning journey(Why, What, How) 
	- identifying bottlenecks 
	- assessing study methods. 

2. **Focus**: Avoid distractions and procrastination.

3. **Directness**: Approach directly towards the goal, instead of over-preparing.

4. **Drill**: Notice and work on your weakest areas.

5. **Retrieval**: Test yourself.

6. **Feedback**: Aim for immediate feedback.

7. **Retention**: Not forgetting what is learned. (related: [[Ingredients for Learning#Repetition|Repetition]])

8. **Intuition**:
	i) Don't give up on hard problems easily.
	ii) Prove things in order to understand them properly.
	iii) Use concrete examples over abstract ones.
	iv) Don't fool yourself into thinking you understand what you don't.

9. **Experimentation**: As you progress in skill, seek unique styles and methods that suit your individual learning journey.
