Key Points: 
- "high diabetes risk at low BMI in South Asians" 
- "...failure of the British to distribute famine relief... Famine appears to have become much more frequent during the British era" (eg. [[Great Bengal Famine of 1770]])

Conclusion: 
The higher risk of Type II diabetes in South Asia as compared to other regions can be attributed to poor management of recourses by colonial powers.
