# MIND PITS
---
3 self-doubt mind pits:

1. **Failure to Launch** (the knowing-doing trap), rumination and overthinking: 
	- "What if I fail?", "What if I'm underqualified?", "What if I've missed something?"

2. **Treading Water** (failing to finish what we start):
	- Hesitation, losing interest, seeking greener grass, getting bored.
3. **Destination Obsession**: ​You set an exciting goal; put in the work & discipline to achieve it. Only to derive a short burst of pleasure, followed by a lack of fulfilment. So you immediately set the next goal.
	- Feeling like you've never done enough.
