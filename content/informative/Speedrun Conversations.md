A link is formed everytime you talk with someone. We are in a World Wide Web of conversations.

1. First Word Floodgate. 
2. Skip the small talk, ask personal questions. 
3. Find the "Me too"s. 
4. Pay a UNIQUE compliment. 
5. Ask for a simple opinion. 
6. Be present, eye contact. 
7. Remember: Name, Place, Animal, Thing.

>Conversation is like reading a book, i.e, the other person. 
>
>A person isn't amount to an abridged version of their entire life story.
