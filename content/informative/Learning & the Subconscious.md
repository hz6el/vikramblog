# Right state of mind
A tranquil mind is more receptive to new information than an chaotic one. 

1. Tranquil state of mind is high ATP brain (generally during sunrise and sunset) 
2. Dopaminergic/emotional activities during the day makes the mind more chaotic (more ADP as ATP gets used up) 
3. ==When you are unable to focus, you use willpower==; further draining your *"ATP mana pool"*.

# How do we learn?

1. Learning is the process of putting ideas from conscious to subconscious mind.
2. Once a samskara or an idea (with or without tied emotions) sinks in your subconscious mind, related thoughts can bubble-up on its own. 
3. {Its the core concept of the movie "Inception"}.
4. Those thoughts will steer you into action, without the use of willpower. 

It's like an automatic ==thought generating machine== planted in your subconscious. 

**Examples of common thought generating machines**: 
Laziness, Social Anxiety, Perfectionism, Competitiveness and High/Low self-esteem.
