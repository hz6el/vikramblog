You should notice your ego and keep it in-check, but what about a person with negative self-image. How do you build a healthy ego?

# Why do we have an ego? 

- Our **identity** learns from comparisons which results in formation of one's ego.
- Sense of identity among people makes social interactions efficient.
- It's a feature of the mind. It’s neither good nor bad. 

**Ego inflation**: due to social media as we have more things for comparison.

# Function of the ego

==The ego protects us from negative emotions== like shame, fear etc.

- **Case 1:** *Positive self-image:* 
		By devaluing those who hurt us, we make ourselves feel better. 
- **Case 2**: *Negative self-image:*
		 By devaluing ourselves, we avoid situations that might hurt us. 

>"The ego is the master of COPIUM."

# Building a healthy ego

A big ego might use humor and "facts" as self-defense. To build a healthy ego, prevent your ego from becoming big.

1. **Comparison feeds the ego**: 
	- Limited your comparison by noticing your ego.
	- By spending time in nature, you also spend time with yourself. 
2. **Learn to tolerate**:
	- ==The more we avoid negative emotions, the more egotistic we become==. 
	- Egotistic people have very low tolerance to negative emotions.

# Meditation 

Three major pillars of mind are *manas* (emotion), *ahamkara* (ego), *buddhi* (intellect).

- the ego and *the self* are seperate. 
- understand what's permanent and fluctuating.
- know the parts of life that is dictated by your thoughts, emotions or something else. 
- recognise the limits of ego.
