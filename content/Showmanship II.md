**[[Showmanship I|PREVIOUS: Showmanship I]]**

Remember to:
1. **Be Big as the Room**: Match your body language according to the size of your audience.
2. **Remove Auditory and Visual clutter**: Habitual fillers and Visual tics decreases your clarity and robs your credibility & authority.
3. **Smile**: Use your "genuine smile" instead of a polite smile. 


> [!NOTE] Duchenne smile
> An authentic smile with raised cheeks and crow's feet wrinkles formed around the eyes.

# How to improve?

1. **Record and Review**: ==Record a 5 min impromptu video== and review after a day.
	- Auditory review on your vocal foundations.
	- Visual review on your body language.
	- Review with transcript and detect your clutter.

2. Create and adapt to your own *Vocal Style*: 
	1. Pick 3-5 public speakers you like and learn their ingredients. 
	2. ==Read books as if you are presenting it to an audience==.
	3. Break out of your mold by talking to new people(neutral ears), try improv classes or reciting children's books.
3. =="Yes and..."==: See spontaneous speaking situations as opportunity and have fun.
