- Over time *something* builds up between people - emotions. 
- Emotions may lead to not listening resulting in a communication with no understanding. 


# Common understanding 

How do you convince someone that you understand them? ==You don't get to share your opinion (or present "data")== 
>"Reflective listening or talking like a NPC." - Chat, 2020 

| We do| We avoid |
| -------- | -------- |
| *reflective listening* | -> *sharing opinion*| 
| *validation* | -> *problem solving*| 
| inquiry  | -> *sympathy* with one-upmanship |

eg. *"I'm so bored, I have nothing to do"*
don't reply with:
>× "Why don't you..." (sharing opinion)
>× "I think you should..." (problem solving)
>× "Oh! Wait till you hear how little i have to do." (sympathy with one-upmanship)

you should say:
> ✓ "That sounds hard to have nothing to do. Do you feel that way?" 


# Finding what to convey 

How to convey your opinion in a non-judgemental way?

1. **Reflect**: Understand yourself and the other person. 
2. **Summery**: Start from their viewpoint or summarise what they said. 
3. **Inquiry**: Ask them what they think. 
4. Make your point. 
5. Ask them to summarise. 
6. Repeat.
