Title:: PARA organization system

PARA system of classifying files is explained in "Build a Second Brain" by Tiago Forte 
PARA stands for Project, Area, Resource, Archive. 

|            |                                                                                               |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project:   | most actionable because youâ€™re working on them right now and with a concrete deadline in mind |
| Area:      | have a longer time horizon and are less immediately actionable                                |
| Resources: | may become actionable depending on the situation                                              |
| Archive:   | remain inactive unless they are needed                                                        |
|            |                                                                                               |

This system focuses on the accessibility of a files relative to it's priority. So the file may move from one file to other. Similar to Zettelkasten system, where Fleeting and Bibliographical notes can be polished into being a Permanent note.
