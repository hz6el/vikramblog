Title:: Non-Deliberate Meditation 

Yoga means "to unite" with ones body, mind and environment. It can be achieved through daily meditation. 
Every person is "mediating" without even deliberately trying. You are meditating when you are playing music, reading a book, listening to splashing water during the shower or sound of chirping & breeze in a park. 

So I think people should add more things that facilitates this experience in our daily lives, unlike the way of adding "go to gym" into our schedule. That's why I often try out breathing techniques on random times during the day.
