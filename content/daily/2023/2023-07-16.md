Title:: A Bucket List Before I Die

This new anime, "Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead" resonated with me. You often feel life is boring or stressful when you are stuck with things that happen to you (things you can't control). 
The way to escape this mind pit, is to do things you want (things you can control). It's nice to have a Bucket List of things you wanna do in life.

Live, Laugh, Love
