Title:: Visual Reading 

I found something interesting.

Visual Reading is a speed reading technique used by the fastest reader(s) in the world.
It involves reading chunks of text rather than using the normal subvocalization method of reading.

It reminded me of [Way of Thinking by Richard Feynman](https://youtu.be/Si6NbKqYEd8) video, where Richard Feynman talks about his mathematician friend being able to keep counting inside his mind and talk simultaneously.

I should try this "visual reading" technique, it's very interesting. Also keeping the conclusion of the Bookstores video in mind: 
You don't wanna abandon the "forced meditation" part that comes with reading normally. Remembering to slow down in this fast-paced modern lifestyle and not losing that scarce introspection time we spend with ourselves while reading the book you love.
