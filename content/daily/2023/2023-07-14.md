Title:: Gamifying Life

How to keep things interesting?

1. For things that are hard → Differentiate the main goal into smaller steps.
2. For things that are easy → Use Time limiters.

Rewarding yourself with things that enables a habit; like getting a sword at the end of a dungeon that makes killing mobs easy.
