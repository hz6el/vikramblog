General public don't care about problems that doesn't effect them directly. 
- They may display concern, it can be a good gossip topic for entertainment. 
- But the things around them always has a higher priority. 
- Also most people live their lives avoiding unnecessary conflicts. 
- Untill it reaches a threshold, where it becomes unbearable to a significant number of people. 

In conclusion, there is no collective action without urgency. It isn't even their job in the first place. That's why we have leaders and elected representatives who are supposed to take care of people.
