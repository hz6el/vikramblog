A soleus push-up is a seated exercise that targets the soleus muscle, which is made up of fatigue-resistant, slow-twitch muscle fibers. 
To perform a soleus push-up, you can:
1. Sit in a chair with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor
2. Point your toes outwards about 45 degrees
3. Flex your calf muscles by pressing your toes into the ground and lifting your heels up
4. Lower your heels and repeat
