## Importance of the Scheme:

1. Linked to New Laws: The approval comes in light of the impending enactment of new criminal laws, which mandate forensic investigations for offences carrying a punishment of seven years or more.
2. Increase in Workload: The new laws are expected to significantly increase the workload of forensic science laboratories (FSLs) across India, which are already struggling with backlogs.
3. Tackling Shortage of Manpower: The scheme aims to tackle the shortage of trained forensic personnel, reduce the backlog in forensic laboratories, and support the Government of India’s objective of achieving a conviction rate exceeding 90%.

## Plans for enhancement

- A new CFSL is also planned for Samba (Jammu & Kashmir).
- Upgrading machinery in CFSL for Narcotic Drugs & Psychotropic Substances, Digital Forensics, DNA Forensic analysis, Forensic Psychology.
- e-Forensics IT Platform linking 117 forensic science laboratories across the country.
- National Forensic Data Centre approved for systematic data management from all forensic labs.
- 9 new off-campuses of NFSU is planned.
